<!-- The DOM (Document Object Model) is a representation of an HTML or XML document as a tree-like structure of objects. 
Each element, attribute, and piece of text in the document is represented by a node in the tree, and these nodes can be manipulated using JavaScript-->

<!-- The document object is a top-level object in the DOM hierarchy that represents the entire HTML or XML document. 
 One of these properties is textContent. The textContent property allows you to get or set the text content of an element. -->
