// Javascript operators are used to assign values, to copmpae values, perform arithmetic operations 
// Operators allows to create a single value from one or more values 


// Binary operators requires two operands one before and one after the operator 
// 2 + 3
//two and three are operands while the (+) is the operator

//Unary operators requires a single operand either before or after the operator
//y++ 
// y is the operand and (+) is the operator

// operaotrs take the number value either literals or variables as their operations and returns a single number value 

var count = 10 + 5 - 4;
console.log(count)

var mult = 3*5 ;
console.log(mult)

var div = 12/4;
console.log(div)

var remainder = 21 % 4
console.log(remainder)
//gives us the remainder of 21 and 4 

// x = 14
// var count = 5
// count + = 4;
// line 30 is adding 4 to 5 
// count = count - 5;
// count - = 5;
// line 33 is subtracting 5 from var count = 5 

// double equals ==
// double equals whether two operands are equal 

// triple equals ===
//strict quality operand and checks using a strict definition of equality 

// Both checks for equality betwwen two values or operands 

var x = 8;
var y = '8';
var equals = x == y;
console.log("hittin here", equals)
//if we want to see if they are equal use the double equal signs
